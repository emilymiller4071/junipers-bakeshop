                <p class="home-paragraph">We started out by selling our treats out of our home.  Friends and 
                    family would request items for parties and gatherings.  As the number of requests increased, it 
                    became obvious that we would need to expand.<br><br>The whole family got involved. Emily, 
                    Dustin, Addie, Dex, and I embarked on a journey that would surpass their wildest dreams! We could 
                    never have fathomed that one day we would be offering our long-treasured recipes to the public
                    in this capacity.  We can't imagine doing anything else, and look forward to what life 
                    brings us next.<br><br>Thank you so much for stopping by.  Take a look around, maybe place 
                    an order or two.
